Ans:

Object in Javascript:

In JavaScript, an object is a complex data type that allows you to store and organize data as key-value pairs. Objects can represent real-world entities, data structures, or abstract concepts. For example, you can create objects to represent a person with properties like name, age, and address, or an array of items with properties like name and price.

Internal Representation of Objects:


Under the hood, JavaScript engines use various data structures and techniques to implement objects efficiently. While the exact internal representation may vary among different JavaScript engines (e.g., V8, SpiderMonkey, or JavaScriptCore), some common concepts apply:

1. Object Properties and Methods: Objects in JavaScript can have properties, which are essentially key-value pairs. Properties can be accessed using dot notation (object.property) or bracket notation (object['property']). Additionally, objects can contain methods, which are functions stored as object properties.
2. Prototype Chain: JavaScript objects have a prototype chain that allows them to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This mechanism enables object-oriented programming and code reuse in JavaScript.
3. Hidden Classes and Inline Caching: JavaScript engines use techniques like hidden classes and inline caching to optimize property access. These mechanisms speed up property access by keeping track of an object's structure and minimizing look-up time.
4. Memory Allocation: JavaScript engines handle memory allocation for objects, ensuring efficient use of memory resources. Objects are dynamically allocated and deallocated as needed.
5. Garbage Collection: JavaScript engines also manage memory by performing garbage collection. Objects that are no longer referenced by the program are automatically cleaned up to free memory resources.ipt
